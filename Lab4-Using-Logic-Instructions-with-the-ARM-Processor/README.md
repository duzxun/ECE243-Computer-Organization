# Lab 4 - Using Logic Instructions with the ARM Processor

## Overview
This laboratory exercise focuses on using logic instructions with the ARM processor in the DE1-SoC computer. Logic instructions are critical in embedded applications for manipulating bit strings, handling data at the bit level, and solving input/output tasks. In this lab, we will use ARM assembly programming to explore these capabilities and implement various tasks on the CPUlator tool and optionally on the DE1-SoC board.

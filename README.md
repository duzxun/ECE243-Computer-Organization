### **Lab 1 - A Simple Processor**
In this lab, a simple processor is designed and implemented. The basic components of a CPU are explored, and a simple instruction set is designed. This lab provides foundational knowledge in processor design.

### Lab 2 - An Enhanced Processor
Building upon the work from Lab 1, this lab introduces enhancements to the simple processor. Additional features, such as more complex instruction sets, are explored to deepen the understanding of processor architecture.

### Lab 3 - Using an ARM Cortex-A9 System
In this lab, the ARM Cortex-A9 processor is used, exploring the architecture of this widely-used processor. Software is written to interact with the processor, learning ARM-specific instructions and system programming.

### Lab 4 - Using Logic Instructions with the ARM Processor
This lab focuses on implementing logic instructions with the ARM processor. Logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT are explored, enabling the writing of more complex programs.

### Lab 5 - Using Input/Output Devices Including a Timer
In this lab, input/output devices, including timers, are used. External hardware is interfaced with, and programs are written to interact with various devices in the system.

### Lab 6 - Using Interrupts with Assembly Language Code
Interrupts are explored to handle asynchronous events in a system. Assembly language code is written to interact with interrupts, improving event handling efficiency and system performance.

### Lab 7 - Introduction to Graphics and Animations
In this final lab, graphics and animations are introduced. Worked with graphical output, including implementing simple animations and visual displays, introducing a higher level of system design and user interaction.

# Lab 3 - Using an ARM Cortex A9 System

## Introduction
This lab exercise provides an introduction to using the ARM® Cortex® A9 processor included in Intel’s Cyclone® V SoC devices. The exercise leverages the DE1-SoC Computer, which includes the ARM processor, memory for storing programs and data, and various I/O ports. The focus is on understanding how to develop programs for the ARM processor, using assembly language, and simulating the programs with the CPUlator tool.

The main goal of this exercise is to get familiarized with ARM processor architecture, its assembly language, and the tools necessary to simulate and debug ARM assembly programs.

## Tools and Resources
- CPUlator: A web-based tool for simulating ARM processor code. It allows you to assemble, execute, and debug ARM assembly programs. You can access CPUlator at the following link: https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc.
- ARMv7 Processor
- DE1-SoC Board Configuration
